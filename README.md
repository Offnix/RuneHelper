# RuneHelper

## Whats all this riff raf?
Runehelper is a lightweight C# windows form based program that collects stats data about your character
With features like stat visualisation, calculators for skills, comparing player stats, Monthly total XP tracking and more.

## Why did you fork? what was wrong with the orignal creators repo?
Well, it was a jointed desiscion when we started creating this program, though because of our differences in workload i was able
to basically create the whole program whislt he had barely any input. I found it annoying that i could not change certain aspects of the 
Repo and this is basically 98% of my own code. It just made sense to host it.

## I can already do all this through other methods, why is this better?
Well, You can goto the runescape highscores page and look at it there. We wont hate you for it. But doing it
through Runehelper can help lessen data usage as the only things that are downloaded is your stats and your avatar picture.
Making it less data intensive and easier to use. Such capabilities like calculators are also avaliable through third party
websites but are no where near as centralized.

## Current features
- Ingame Clock 
- Grand Exchange lookup
- PLayer total xp tracking (monthly)
- Calculators for skills Woodcutting,Mining,Firemaking, Agility, silverhawk feathers
- Compare player stats
- Wikia quick launch through right click menu
- PLayer Avatar viewing 
- automatic combat level calculator
- Fully customiseable colour scheme and theme for whole program

## So is this heavy intensive on hardware?
In a short answer, No. We pride ourselves how less intensive this program really is. You can expect an average usage of 14 mb when
when seen task manager.This usage of ram is nothing compared to how much an individual web-browser tab can take up. 

## So is there a release version yet?
Yep, after a long time we have finally created a release, go download our beta at the releases page!
