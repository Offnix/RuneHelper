# RuneHelper

## Whats all this riff raf?
Runehelper is a lightweight C# windows form based program that collects stats data about your character
With features like stat visualisation, calculators for skills, comparing player stats, Monthly total XP tracking and more.

## I can already do all this through other methods, why is this better?
Well, You can goto the runescape highscores page and look at it there. We wont hate you for it. But doing it
through Runehelper can help lessen data usage as the only things that are downloaded is your stats and your avatar picture.
Making it less data intensive and easier to use. Such capabilities like calculators are also avaliable through third party
websites but are no where near as centralized.

## So is this heavy intensive on hardware?
In a short answer, No. We pride ourselves how less intensive this program really is. You can expect an average usage of 14 mb when
when seen task manager.This usage of ram is nothing compared to how much an individual web-browser tab can take up. 

## So is there a release version yet?
Sadly no, but one day soon there will be! this program has alot of potential and capabilities we havent explored yet.
And of currently we do not see there is enough features to gain a stable base of users. But hopefully that is in the near future. But you can surely look at our preview <a href="http://imgur.com/5aeFAXX"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/5aeFAXX.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a> (Updated 14/11/2016)
